## About me
**My name is Tess**
and I am career switching out of ~~teaching~~ to ***tech***!

I am inspired by Ada Lovelace and all women in programming.


> Imagine a world where the Ada Lovelaces of tomorrow grow up to be optimistic and brave about technology and use it to create a new world that is wonderful, whimsical, and a tiny bit weird.
